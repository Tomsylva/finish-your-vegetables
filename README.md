Hi there

You have found my portfolio project for the final module of the Ironhack Remote Bootcamp, built with the MERN stack along with a few extra libraries such as Leaflet and Framer Motion.

This will, like any good coding project, be a continuous working progress.

Whoever you are, I hope you have a wonderful day.
